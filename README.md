# File Management System using Django:

## Description
I have designed and developed a comprehensive file management web application using Django. This application allows users to add, update, and delete files in various formats, including PDFs, images, documents, audio, and video files. Users can register to upload files, while file downloads are available without login. The application features functionalities for adding titles, descriptions, and files, editing existing files, deleting files, and updating profile details. Additionally, the Django Admin Interface provides site administrators with the capability to manage all files and users.
